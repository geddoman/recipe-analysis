# Recipe Analysis

This is a small on-going project using recipe data to perform NLP and text analysis tasks.

Currently it contains 2 Jupyter Notebooks that can be viewed:
1. [Recipe Text Analysis] (https://github.com/geddoman/recipe-analysis/blob/master/RecipeTextAnalysis.ipynb)
2. [LDA Model for Recipes] (https://github.com/geddoman/recipe-analysis/blob/master/LDAModel.ipynb)
